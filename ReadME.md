# Glelateria Ordering System :ice_cream:
Welcome to the Gelateria Ordering System! This project is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to order gelato
from a selection of flavors, choose the number of scoops, and calculate the total price.



### :icecream: Features
Users can select from a list of gelato flavors.
Each flavor has a specific price per scoop.
The system allows the user to choose how many scoops they want.
The total price for the order is calculated based on the chosen flavor and number of scoops.
Some flavors are marked as "Work In Progress" (WIP), and selecting them will notify the user to choose a different flavor.

### :icecream: How It Works
The user is greeted and prompted to enter their name.
A menu of gelato flavors is displayed with along with each price.
The user selects a flavor by entering the associated number.
If a flavor marked as WIP is selected, the system informs the user and asks them to restart.
If a valid flavor is selected, the user is asked how many scoops they would like.
The total price is calculated, and the user is given an order summary with the total price.


### :icecream: How to Run the Program
+ Clone or download this repository.
+ Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred Java IDE).
+ Run the Main.java file.
+ Follow the prompts in the console to create your gelato order.

### :icecream: Future Improvements 
+ **Add more flavors:** Currently, two flavors are marked as "Work In Progress" (WIP). These can be fully implemented in future versions.
+ **Invalid input handling:** Would be good to implement for incorrect selections and redirect users to enter another option.
+ **Improve user interface:** This is a simple console-based application. A graphical user interface could be added.
+ **Extend functionality:** Add options for cones, toppings, and sauces, and integrate them into the pricing structure.
